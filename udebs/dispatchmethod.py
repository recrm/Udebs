def dispatchmethod(func):
    """
    This provides for a way to use ``functools.singledispatch`` inside of a class. It has the same
    basic interface that ``singledispatch`` does:
    
    >>> class A:
    ...     @dispatchmethod
    ...     def handle_message(self, message):
    ...         # Fallback code...
    ...         pass
    ...     @handle_message.register(int)
    ...     def _(self, message):
    ...         # Special int handling code...
    ...         pass
    ...
    >>> a = A()
    >>> a.handle_message(42)
    # Runs "Special int handling code..."
    
    Note that using ``singledispatch`` in these cases is impossible, since it tries to dispatch
    on the ``self`` argument, not the ``message`` argument. This is technically a double
    dispatch, since both the type of ``self`` and the type of the second argument are used to
    determine what function to call - for example:
    
    >>> class A:
    ...     @dispatchmethod
    ...     def handle_message(self, message):
    ...         print('A other', message)
    ...         pass
    ...     @handle_message.register(int)
    ...     def _(self, message):
    ...         print('A int', message)
    ...         pass
    ...
    >>> class B:
    ...     @dispatchmethod
    ...     def handle_message(self, message):
    ...         print('B other', message)
    ...         pass
    ...     @handle_message.register(int)
    ...     def _(self, message):
    ...         print('B int', message)
    ...
    >>> def do_stuff(A_or_B):
    ...     A_or_B.handle_message(42)
    ...     A_or_B.handle_message('not an int')
    
    On one hand, either the ``dispatchmethod`` defined in ``A`` or ``B`` is used depending
    upon what object one passes to ``do_stuff()``, but on the other hand, ``do_stuff()``
    causes different versions of the dispatchmethod (found in either ``A`` or ``B``) 
    to be called (both the fallback and the ``int`` versions are implicitly called).
    
    Note that this should be fully compatable with ``singledispatch`` in any other respects
    (that is, it exposes the same attributes and methods).
